Scripts underlying the analysis currently submitted as 'Limited effect of future land-use changes on human heat stress and labour capacity' to Earth's Future

The notebooks were used to make the different plots within the manuscripts, func_sdh_oe.py is a general scripts with small python functions to support the data processing.
The script calc_wbgt.py is based on the python implementation of the Liljegren method for computing WBGT as presented in Kong and Huber et al. (2022)
The scripts heat_index.py and response_functions.py were used to compute ESI and the labour capacity based on teh various heat stress indicators used.
